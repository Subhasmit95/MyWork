****This folder contains The entire project in Three parts **********
****We Need all the hardwire to run the project, which includes 3 webcamera and a MUSE S EEG reader **********

we used jupyter Notebook to build the project and the files are in IPYNB format

Final Dissertation needs the hardware
***************************************
This is the combined project.

---> to run the code the Final_Dissertation.ipynb it needs to execute in the jupyter notebook
---> the file must have yolov3.cfg,yolov3.weights,coco.names in the same location

eyeblinkdetectionusing_EEG_CNN_LSTM_and_Ensemble
*******************
This part predict the blinks event using BCI by processing the EEG signals using Different Algorithm 

---> to run the code eyeblinkdetectionusing_EEG_CNN_LSTM_and_Ensemble.ipynb it needs to execute in the jupyter notebook
---> the file must have the Eyeblinkdata.csv and testdata.csv in the same folder.

EyeblinkdetectionUsingImageProcessing
**************************************************
This part predict the blinks event using a webcam.

---> to run the code EyeblinkdetectionUsingImageProcessing.ipynb it needs to execute in the jupyter notebook
---> It must have a webcam connected to it.
